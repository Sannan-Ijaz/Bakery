<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>GA Bakers Inc is an inventory management application which uses PostgreSQL and ruby to manage an owner's inventory of daily items. The customers can login and see theorders that are dispatched to them. The idea came from my mother who bakes cakes for family's birthday parties. Since I have a large family, my mother uses a notebook to write down her entries. The holistic idea was to build a platform where she could manage her business.</p>
<h2>Development</h2>
<p><h3>Technologies Used:</h3></p>
<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
<li>Sinatra</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<h3>Process</h3>
<p>RoR: Ruby was used in this application to communicate with backend. Queries were written in ruby to manage the inventory and the user databases.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL was used to create tables for users and the inventory.</p>
<p>HTML: To display different queries, HTML was used</p>
<p>CSS: Styling was done through CSS</p>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<p>There are a lot of improvements that can be done in the application to improve the user experience and usability. For example: in the future, a data insights table is to be added where the owner will be able to see their most popular items and get any feedback from the customers. </p>
